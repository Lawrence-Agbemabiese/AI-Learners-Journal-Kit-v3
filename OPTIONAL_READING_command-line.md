## How to Use These with Your AI Learner’s Journal

**Capture prompts (paste into your Journal):**
- *After first session:* “List 5 commands I’ll reuse this week and 1 mistake I now know how to avoid.”  
- *Pipes & redirects:* “Chain 2–3 commands I actually need (`|`, `>`, `>>`); explain each step in one sentence.”  
- *Globbing & search:* “Write 2 ‘danger aware’ examples with `*` and `grep -R` and note safeguards.”  
- *Mini-script:* “Create a 3–5 line Bash script that saves me 60 seconds/day; log before/after.”

**Practice idea:** Convert one routine (renaming files, moving screenshots, or backing up a folder) into a single reusable command or tiny script. Add it to your Journal’s *Reusable Snippets* section.

> Tip: Don’t memorize; **compose**. Use your Journal to record patterns you can remix later.
